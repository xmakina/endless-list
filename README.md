# Clarity Endless List
Submission to Clarity Hackathon Level 1

# Purpose
A contract which will allow other contracts to maintain a bottomless, paged, list of items
This would have included `trait` implementations but there is [an open issue](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/issues/1621) about this

# Demonstration
* Add an item
* Add as many items as you like
* Open a random page
* Walk through the list using the `next` property
